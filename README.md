# PhysicsSolver

An equations solver application written in Java using JavaFX

It allows for the user to:
1. Input a set of equations (or alternatively import them from a text file), after which the application will parse the equations for variables and constants
2. Input values for all the known parsed variables

After which, the application will:
1. Solve for all variables it can, using the inputted known variables and the equations provided
2. Provide derivations for the solved variables
